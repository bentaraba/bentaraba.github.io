For my STAT 2521 group project, We analyzed a gym workout dataset of male and female members (ages 18–59) containing both fitness/vitals metrics (e.g., height, weight, BMI, BPM, calories burned, water intake) and workout descriptors (workout type, session duration, frequency, experience level).Using R-style statistical workflows and presentation-ready visualizations, we combined exploratory analysis with inferential methods (t-tests, chi-squared tests, simple linear regression, and multiple regression) to study what drives calories burned and BMI.Key results showed a strong positive relationship between session duration and calories burned (with duration remaining a major predictor even after adding other variables), plus additional effects from factors like gender, heart-rate metrics, and body measurements; BMI alone was not a strong predictor in a simple regression, but showed evidence of association when grouped into categories.
