2025 Temple University T.H.E. (Tourism, Hospitality, and Events) Analytics Case Competition.

Worked with a real-world hotel dataset to quantify the impact of local events pop star concerts and festivals on hotel performance. Built an event calendar + KPI framework (occupancy, ADR, Revenue PAR) to identify lift, timing effects (lead/lag), and differences by event type. Summarized insights in a presentation and proposed revenue-management actions (dynamic pricing, targeted promos, staffing adjustments).
