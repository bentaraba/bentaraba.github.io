Temple University's Third Annual City of Brotherly Stats Sport Analytics Case Competition


We analyzed Temple’s offense for Temple University’s Third Annual City of Brotherly Stats Sport Analytics Case Competition using 2022 FBS play-by-play data, defining success by down-and-distance (40% on 1st, 60% on 2nd, convert on 3rd/4th), which yielded a 39.21% success rate (329/839). I then built a play-by-play win probability model (final margin ~ Normal with mean tied to the Vegas spread and σ≈18.41) and computed win probability added as the pre/post change each play and drive win probability added as the sum across a drive, showing 5+ play drives were most consistently positive. Results indicated Temple was most successful when passing, in shotgun, and with specialized personnel, while pressure, later downs, and long-to-go hurt efficiency—supporting recommendations focused on pass-forward sequencing, better protection, and early-down efficiency.
